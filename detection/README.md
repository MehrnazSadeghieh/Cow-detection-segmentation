# Detection
In this project, we are working on a cow dataset
- First we break the videos to frames
- Then we annotated the frames using makesense.ai website
- In the next step we splitted the dataset as follows:
      train = 70%,test = 15%, validation = 15%
- And finally we trained our dataset using different versions of YOLO
